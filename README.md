## How to run this Project on your Development Server?

Before we begin, let's ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine, as the project's server is built on JavaScript. Once Node.js is installed, simply run the command "node index.js" in your terminal. Then, open this URL "http://localhost:5000/" to view your project. This will allow you to see the project in action and get started with development.
